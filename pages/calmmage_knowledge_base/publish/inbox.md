## Case 1

## Problem

How do I quickly open my Foam workspace - in vscode

### Solution

Raycast -> "Create Script Command"

``

Github Code link: https://github.com/calmmage/calmmage/blob/main/calmmage/beta/raycast/foam.sh

#### Bonus

More script commands in the community 
https://github.com/raycast/script-commands/tree/master/commands#apps

### Considered alternatives

#### Could have worked

- Console alias 'foam' to open the dir in vscode

#### Didn't work

- Tried Raycast "Add Quicklink"
- [Raycast Alias](https://manual.raycast.com/command-aliases-and-hotkeys) (for a command) 
  - Only can add alias for existing commands. 
  - So would need to create an extension and add an alias for the command

## Case 2

### c2-Problem

How do I quickly add a new alias?
For example, a `foam` alias I declared above?

### c2-Solution

Add an alias `aa` (add alias)

```bash
aa() {
    echo "" >> ~/.alias
    echo "# $3" >> ~/.alias
    echo "alias $1=\"$2\"" >> ~/.alias; source ~/.alias
}
```

### Bonus

I've asked ChatGPT to generate me that (as well as some other aliases / shortcuts)

## Case 3

### c3-Problem

It's hard to type "Foam" every time
And it's scary to add global shortcuts for apps - for example Cmd+F

### c3-Solution

Add Raycast shortcut! 

~~Raycast shortcuts only work when you're within Raycast (Cmd + Space)~~

So, I've added 'Cmd+F' for Foam and it doesn't override anything
Raycast doesn't have a Search/Find function which is usually bound to `Cmd+F`
Scratch that, the shortcuts ARE global!
I ended up using Ctrl instead of Cmd, should be ok for now

## Case 4

## Case 6

### c6-Problem

How do I stop gmail / google calendar from opening in a separate Chrome App when switching

### c6-Solution

Didn't work: I've tried deleting the chrome app - but chrome just installed it again!

Instead, I've opened the app
Upper right corner -> app settings
Disable "Open as Window" - for each app

- Settings

- "Open as Window"
	- ![[Pasted image 20240208030641.png]]

## Case 7

### c7-Problem

Can't search effectively in PyCharm because of .venv files

### c7-Solution

Option 1: .venv -> right click -> Mark Directory as -> Excluded
Doesn't work - still shows up in search

Option 2: Settings > Editor > File Types > Ignore Files and Folders: add .venv
Works!

Option 3: Create a custom search space with regexps
Search -> Spaces -> add a new space -> add a regexp
Example for multiple folders - very tedious:
```
(file[
abstract-tool-user]:*/||file[
archivist-bot]:*/||file[
bot-lib]:*/||file[
bot-lib-bot-template]:*/||file[
calmapp]:*/||file[
calmlib]:*/||file[
calmmage-feature-bot]:*/||file[
calmmage-task-tracker]:*/||file[
electron-app-demo]:*/)&&!file[abstract-tool-user
]:.venv//*&&!file[archivist-bot
]:.venv//*&&!file[bot-lib
]:.venv//*&&!file[bot-lib-bot-template
]:.venv//*&&!file[calmapp
]:.venv//*&&!file[calmlib
]:.venv//*&&!file[calmmage-feature-bot
]:.venv//*&&!file[calmmage-task-tracker

```
